# Twitter Tweet Fetcher

This script fetches tweets from Twitter using Selenium automation. It reads tweet IDs from a file and attempts to fetch the content of each tweet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver (matching your Chrome version)
- Selenium (installed via pip)

## Installation

### For Mac Users

1. Install ChromeDriver:
```bash
brew install --cask chromedriver
```

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### For Other Operating Systems

1. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make sure you have Chrome browser installed

3. Download ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version from: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python3 fetch_user_tweets.py  # For Mac
# or
python fetch_user_tweets.py   # For other systems
```

The script will:
1. Prompt for your Twitter username/email and password
2. Read tweet IDs from the input file
3. Fetch tweets using Selenium
4. Save progress to `user_tweets_progress.json`

## Notes

- The script includes rate limiting and retry mechanisms to avoid being blocked
- Progress is saved after each user is processed
- If the script is interrupted, it will resume from where it left off
- Maximum 21 tweets are fetched per user
- A new browser session is created after every 100 tweets

## Output

The script creates a JSON file `user_tweets_progress.json` containing the fetched tweets in the following format:
```json
{
  "user_id": [
    {
      "id": "tweet_id",
      "text": "tweet_text",
      "url": "tweet_url"
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```
